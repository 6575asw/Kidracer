<p style="color:green;">Answer: Earth's seasons are caused by 1) Earth's titled axis and 2) Earth's revolution (orbit) around the sun. When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun we have summer. When the Northern Hemisphere is titled away from the sun we have winter.</p>
<p style="color:yellow;">It actually takes the Earth slightly over 23 hours and 56 minutes to rotate once around this axis. In this time all the stars appear to revolve once around the Earth and return to their starting positions. Astronomers call this period of time a sidereal.</p>

<p style="color:Orange;">The Moon formed much closer to Earth than it is today. As Earth rotates, the Moon's gravity causes the oceans to seem to rise and fall. (The Sun also does this, but not as much.) There is a little bit of friction between the tides and the turning Earth, causing the rotation to slow down just a little.</p>
